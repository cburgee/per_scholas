Trivia Quiz Game
This is a simple game taking a roster of players and asking them a set of questions one at a time. Once the current player gets 5 questions correct, the total amount questions they have been asked is recorded and that is their final score. Once everyone has gone, the final scores are compared and the lowest wins.

I used main loops for the main game and restarting and had a loop iterate through the amount of players that are playing and then ask them questions until they get 5 correct. I ran into a problem with the main loops of the game and browser updating. Due to my lack of time I opted to keep the loop, and sacrifice some of the visuals for the game.

This was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To run the program, install the provided files and launch a web server using the html file.

Lastly, here is a link to the live site if you would like to try the game for yourself:
